Introduction:
Our chatbot has a huge impact on the health culture of the society.
 It has improved reliability and is less prone to human errors. 
Today’s people are more likely addicted to internet but they are 
not concerned about their personal health. They avoid hospital 
treatment for small issues which may become a major disease in future.
Our proposed idea can solve this problem. Our idea mainly focuses on creating
a chatbot which is cost free and available throughout the day for all people.
The facts that the chatbot is free and can be accessed wherever the user is, be
it their working environment, prompt the user to have it and use it. It saves   
the overhead involved in consulting specialized doctors.
To Predict disease when user inputs their personal details, medical history and 
their symptoms which they are currently experiencing due to the disease.


Planning and Scheduling:
First We need to import the data from the dataset and clean the data for any null values and other symbols which are present while importing.
After importing we can use tools such as tableu,seaborn library , ploty to visualize our dataset for getting the optimal train, test split ,
a brief idea about the model predictions and much more.Then we need to split the data for training , validation and the test dataset for training 
and testing our chatbot model.We need to preprocess the extracted data with domains such as tokenization , stemming , stop words removal for our data set.
Then we need a suitable ML algorithm (decision tree/KNN) to train our model with and get a optimal accuracy for our chatbot.Then we need to improve 
our model with our validation dataset by setting up optimizations such as learning rate , number of epochs etc..
